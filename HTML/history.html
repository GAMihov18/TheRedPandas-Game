			<p>Pachisi was created in India in the 6th century. The earliest evidence of this game evolution in India is the depiction of boards on the caves of Ellora. The original version is also described in Mahabharata, where Draupadi was put on stake by Pandavas. It was also known as "Chopad". The contemporary version was played by the Mughal emperors of India; a notable example is Akbar.</p>
			<p>Pachisi was modified to use a cubic die with dice cup and patented as "Ludo" in England in 1896. The Royal Navy took Ludo and converted it into the board game Uckers.</p>
